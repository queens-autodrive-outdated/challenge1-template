# Tricolour Challenge #1
This repository is a starter for the first tricolour challenge! ðŸš˜ðŸ”¥

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repository into your own repository.
2. Once you have completed Step #1, let Brent know so he can give the correct access rights to the repositories.
3. Run `python3 main.py` and make sure that your python installation works!

## Datasets
We've included the test data that you'll be evaluated on at the first challenge.


These images *should* be on the easier end of classification for your systems. 
Keep this in mind when you design your systems! Will your stop signs always be the focus of the image? 

## Resources
`resources.md` contains a consolidated list of tutorials and resources that we've found useful in developing our own systems.
